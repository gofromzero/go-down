# 具有 Web 和 CLI 界面的下载管理器

Download a file with multiple connections Be able to resume Show downloading progress on CLI and Web.

Try to break things down for yourself. For instance, start by learning how to read a file on the internet. 
Then, try to write the file on the disk. 
By doing these two steps, officially, you’d have a downloader. 
Now try to improve it by adding and enhancing it step by step.

## You’d learn:
- Work with HTTP related packages/libraries to read file from a remote address
- Work with file systems to write file on the disk and have resume ability
- Goroutine to manage multiple connections and writing on the dist at the same time
- Work with CLI I/O to parse input arguments and show a proper progress bar
- Work with web-related functions/libraries to create a web interface
